# GnoTalks Contact Database - Instruction Manual

## Introduction
The GnoTalks Contact Database is a vital resource designed to manage the details of speakers who were invited to GnoTalks at MNNIT but couldn't attend due to various reasons. By maintaining and updating this database, future teams can save significant time and effort in research, ensuring continuity and efficiency in inviting speakers. This resource benefits not only the current team but also future teams long after we've left MNNIT, as they won't need to redo the same research to fetch contacts.

## Why Use This Database?
- **Efficient Tracking**: Keep a record of invited speakers who haven't yet visited.
- **Ease of Access**: Quickly fetch speaker details when planning future events.
- **Data Security**: Utilizes encryption to securely store sensitive information such as phone numbers.
- **Deletion**: Easily delete records of speakers once they visit.

## Streamlit Apps
There are three Streamlit apps provided to manage the database:
1. **add_contacts**: Add new contacts to the database.
2. **fetch_contacts**: Fetch and display contacts based on the input name.
3. **delete_contacts**: Delete contacts based on their ID.

### Adding Contacts
To add new contacts, run the `add_contacts` Streamlit app. This app will prompt you to enter the speaker details to be added to the database.

### Fetching Contacts
To fetch and display contacts, run the `fetch_contacts` Streamlit app. This app will prompt you for the name of the speaker to search for. It will then display all matching records with their details.

### Deleting Contacts
To delete contacts, run the `delete_contacts` Streamlit app. This app will prompt you for the name of the speaker to search for. It will then display all matching records with their IDs and ask you to enter the IDs of the records to be deleted.

## Running the Streamlit Apps
